        <h2>Protochill</h2>
        <p>A Unity Editor Package which uses LLM technologies to help prototype or develop a game or application.</p>
        <p>The main goal is to overcome the difficulties of human-machine interactions when dealing with vast object oriented structures.</p>
        <p>The commonly used chatbox is often not sufficient, so the package additionnaly showcases a UML graphical interface and makes sure the correct class context is given to the LLM at each step</p>
        <p>I initiated the idea for this project, and with the support of my school and fellow students, I successfully led a small team of two other developers to bring it to completion.</p>
        <p>The biggest issue came with Unity's life cycle : when the package writes files the Editor needs to recompile, which effectively destroys all objects, making consistency a challenge for both package developpers and users</p>
        <p>This issue was solved by using a cache file and a solid architecture that auto saves/updates itself in the cache file</p>

        <p>Here is an exemple of the integration of the package in an existing game, the SCHMUP you can find on the first page.</p>
        <p>A Regex reads into the scripts to decifer the classes and the package creates the UML to make the code base interactible using the chatbox and the graph.</p>

        <p>Here is an exemple of the use of the package to build a new project from scratch, utilizing the chatbox, UML and levelDesign features to build a game quickly.</p>
